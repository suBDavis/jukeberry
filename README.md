jukeberry
=========

Hacky set of files and programs for using the Ras Pi like a jukebox. Managed by web.

Don't attempt to use this yet.  The paths for the shell scripts and files are ALL outta wack.

Thanks to https://github.com/gsteph/groove-dl for the grooveshark downloader.  

NOTE: must use my version of groove.py.  His contains bugs I had to fix.  The project is no longer active so pull requests are being ignored.
